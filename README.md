# PyImageTrack
PyImageTrack is a Python library implementing feature tracking approaches based on the normalized cross-correlation and least-squares matching for usage on rock glaciers.
## Features
- Image alignment based on a reference area
- Creation of a grid of track points
- Feature tracking using the normalized cross-correlation or least-squares matching methods with symmetric and asymmetric search windows
- Visualization of movement data
- Calculation of the Level of Detection of a performed tracking
- Removing outliers based on movement bearing and movement rate in the surrounding area
